		In New York State, reports of HABs have increased annually since over recent decades. However,
		there is scant data to conclude that algal bloom intensity or annual duration has increased
		statewide. Monitoring algal blooms is cost, time, and equipment intensive, and public data
		availability is lacking outside of safe beach monitoring programs.
	</p>

	<p>
		In this Climate Change Research Initiative study, our team was successful in creating a
		remote-sensing based random forest regression (RF) model. This model utilizes both Landsat-8 & 9
		and Sentinel-2 images to create a robust dataset of algal bloom predictions with an R2 = 0.676.
		The RF model can be applied to entire lakes from 2013 - present day to both lakes with and
		without previous sampling.
	</p>

	<p>
		Our team has created this public facing interface for our results where stakeholders and
		interested citizens can view an area of interest over time. Users are able to view time series
		plots of individual lakes, download data, and learn more about the algal bloom issues in New
		York.
